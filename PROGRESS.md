# Progress

## Done

- **Stage 0: Project Scaffold**
  - Created directory layout:
    - `backend/app/` (`__init__.py`, `config.py`, `extensions.py`, `models.py`, `storage/`, `routes/`)
    - `backend/tests/` (`__init__.py`, `test_health.py`)
    - `backend/wsgi.py`
    - `backend/requirements.txt`
    - `frontend/` (scaffolded with Vite React TypeScript template)
    - `infra/`
    - `loadtest/`
    - `docs/screenshots/`
  - Created Python virtual environment in `backend/.venv` (Python 3.12).
  - Installed all backend dependencies from `AGENTS.md` (Flask 3, SQLAlchemy 2, PyMySQL, PyJWT, bcrypt, boto3, python-frontmatter, gunicorn, pytest) and pinned exact versions into `backend/requirements.txt`.
  - Created `.gitignore` ignoring dependencies, virtualenvs, local databases, build outputs, environment files, and local data directory.
  - Created `.env.example` containing all required configuration variables with default values.
  - Built Flask application factory in `backend/app/__init__.py` loading environment configuration and exposing `GET /api/health` returning `{"status": "ok", "version": "0.1.0"}` without database access.
  - Wrote pytest test in `backend/tests/test_health.py` and verified it passes.
  - Verified Flask server starts and `/api/health` returns HTTP 200 with JSON payload.
  - Created root `README.md` and initialized `PROGRESS.md`.

## Next

- Stage 1: Auth & User Model implementation according to `docs/SPEC.md` (registration, login, JWT cookies, password hashing).

## Decisions

- Set default port to 8000 in `backend/wsgi.py` aligned with the single container specification in `docs/SPEC.md`.
- Stored exact pinned dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt` using UTF-8 encoding.
- Configured Flask app factory to accept optional configuration overrides for testing while defaulting to `Config` object.

## Known issues

- None.
